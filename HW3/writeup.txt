1. Among the three data structures you used, which performed the best, why?

2. All parts of the program are working as should

3. In the hashmap and list implementations, it appears that it takes a small amount of time to calculate for 
showNamesAlphaabetically. Although in the list implementation it is highly likely due to the fact that we use 
insertion sort to sort for all of the names rather than a more efficient sorting method such as quicksort or 
merge sort

4. One of the most challenging parts of the assignment was doing the hashmap implentation, specifically the 
mostPopularName method because the hashmap does not keep order so we had to keep a ranking variable in the 
Node object in order to keep the order of most popular name.
